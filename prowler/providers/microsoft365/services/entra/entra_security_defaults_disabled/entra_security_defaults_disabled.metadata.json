  "Description": "Disabling Security Defaults allows organizations to implement more granular and advanced security controls beyond the predefined settings. This ensures that security policies are aligned with organizational requirements rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach.",
  "Risk": "Security Defaults in Microsoft Entra ID provide preconfigured security settings to protect organizations from common attacks. While these defaults enhance security by enforcing MFA, blocking legacy authentication, and implementing other protections, they may also prevent organizations from applying custom security policies tailored to their specific needs.",
